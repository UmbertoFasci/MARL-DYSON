# MARL-Dyson
## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Optimization: A Dyson Swarm Simulation

### Project Status: Early Development

This project is actively under development. Features and documentation will be updated regularly.

## Overview

MARL-Dyson simulates resource optimization using multi-agent reinforcement learning. It models autonomous agents optimizing their positions around a central energy source, inspired by the concept of a Dyson swarm.
