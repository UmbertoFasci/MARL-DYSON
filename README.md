# MARL-Dyson
## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Optimization: A Dyson Swarm Simulation

### Project Status: Early Development

This project is actively under development. Features and documentation will be updated regularly.

## Overview

MARL-Dyson simulates resource optimization using multi-agent reinforcement learning. It models autonomous agents optimizing their
positions around a central energy source, inspired by the concept of a Dyson swarm.

## Energy Distribution Generation

The energy distribution is generated by creating a uniform random field across a spherical coordinate grid, with values between
0 and 1. A Gaussian smoothing filter is then applied to this random field, creating continuous regions of varying energy levels.
The smoothing parameter controls the transition gradient between these regions. The final distribution is normalized to ensure
all values remain in the [0,1] range.

# Swarm Agent Definition

The initial development of MARL system is based on the class definition of the swarm agent, where coordinate location, energy
collection, directionality, and movement is defined. This is a simple implementation of the swarm agent rule set, and more will
be experimented with in the future. These future experiements include a ruleset introduction where only a single agent can occupy
a coordinate location at a time, thus limiting movement and generating a more dynamic environment.
