## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Optimization: A Dyson Swarm Simulation

### Project Status: Early Development

This project is actively under development. Features and documentation will be updated regularly.

## Overview

MARL-Dyson simulates resource optimization using multi-agent reinforcement learning. It models autonomous agents optimizing their
positions around a central energy source, inspired by the concept of a Dyson swarm.

## Stage 1 - Energy Distribution Generation

The energy distribution is generated by creating a uniform random field across a spherical coordinate grid, with values between
0 and 1. A Gaussian smoothing filter is then applied to this random field, creating continuous regions of varying energy levels.
The smoothing parameter controls the transition gradient between these regions. The final distribution is normalized to ensure
all values remain in the [0,1] range.
